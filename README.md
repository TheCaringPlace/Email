## Introduction

Sendra is an open-source email platform built on top of AWS and [sst](https://sst.dev/) It allows you to easily send emails from applications or via campaigns.

It can be considered as an open source, cloud-hosted alternative to services
like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Resend](https://resend.com) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/).

Sendra is a fork of [Plunk](https://useplunk.com/) with a focus on a lighter footprint and costs. It uses AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to ensure ensure you're only paying for what you use.

## Features
